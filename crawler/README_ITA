How to cross-check:

1. Establish available datasets on XRootD (Geneva, Italy):
	gva prefix: root://grid05.unige.ch:1094/
	ita prefix: root://xrootd-dampe.cloud.ba.infn.it/

	Establish filelist using
		> xrdfs *prefix* ls *folder-where-files-are-stored* 

	Write as sets_gva.txt, sets_ita.txt 

2. For all datasets, establish list of available files
	Something like:
		> for f in $(cat sets_gva.txt); do xrdfs ** ls $f ; done
	Write as files_gva.txt, files_ita.txt

3. Take the list of bad files as produced by crawler and add as badFiles.txt

4. Run "find.py". Will write "found_gva.txt", "found_ita.txt" as files located on XRootD that are potential back-ups

5. Run "addPrefix.py" on both found_gva.txt, found_ita.txt

6. Move to "crawl" subfolder and crawl over xrd_ita.txt, xrd_gva.txt
